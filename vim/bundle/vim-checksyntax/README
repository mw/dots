The checksyntax plugin runs an external syntax checker for the current buffer 
whenever the buffer is saved (by calling the |:CheckSyntax| command). Syntax 
errors are managed as location or quickfix lists. If any syntax error occurs, 
the |location-list| is opened (users can redefine |CheckSyntaxFail()| to change 
this behaviour). You can use any |location-list| related command to navigate 
the list of syntax errors.

If vimscript #2584 is installed, lines containing syntax errors will be marked 
with signs.

As the plugin doesn't provide syntax checks by its own, the external 
syntax checker has to be installed on your computer.

By default, |:CheckSyntax| is mapped to <F5> (if not mapped already), 
and automatically executed when saving the buffer. The |:CheckSyntax| 
command takes one optional argument: the mode (default: &filetype).

The following modes are pre-defined (syntax checking requires the 
respective syntax checker software to be installed):

    c, cpp :: Check syntax via splint
    html :: Check syntax via tidy
    javascript :: Check syntax via jsl or gjslint
    java :: Check syntax via jlint or javaCheckstyle
    lua :: Parse file (luac -p)
    php  :: Check syntax (php -l)
    phpp :: Parse a file (php -f) (alternative php checker)
    python :: Check file with pyflakes
    pylint :: Use the pylint compiler plugin (alternative python checker)
    ruby :: Check syntax (ruby -c; no auto-checks)
    tex, latex :: Parse file (chktex -q -v0; no auto-checks)
    xml, docbk :: Check syntax via xmllint

See |g:checksyntax| for a complete list. See |g:checksyntax| also for 
how to define your own syntax checkers.

This plugin was originally based on Klaus Horsten's php_console 
(vimscript #779) and it is the successor of php_check_syntax.vim 
(vimscript #1272). In opposition to php_console, it is not a php 
ftplugin but a general solution for checking the syntax when saving a 
file (using the appropriate interpreter, lint or whatsoever).
