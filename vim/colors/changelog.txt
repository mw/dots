# Changelog for xterm16.vim
xterm16-2.2
    Thu May 26 09:47:36 2005; Gautam Iyer <gautam@math.uchicago.edu>
    - Added mrxvt and rxvt 256 color support (options xterm16_termtype and
      xterm16_ccube).

    - Added the program rgb_level to get the intensities of a uniform rgbi
      color cube and a patch to set the mrxvt color cube.

    - Allowed xterm16bg_Group & xterm16fg_Group to contain color names (from
      this colorscheme). Thus setting xterm16bg_Normal='none' gives
      transparency in mrxvt :)

    - A trivial perl script to generate a custom terminal 6x6x6 color cube,
      the Xresources file from xterm16_palette, and CSS files for web hosting.

    - Few minor color modifications to the soft colormap.
